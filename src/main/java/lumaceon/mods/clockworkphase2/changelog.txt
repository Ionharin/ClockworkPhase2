Release Candidate 2
-Added degradation recipe to the Recipe Sorter.
-Fixed server-sided imports of client classes in packet handling. Should no longer crash dedicated servers.
-Changed guidebook textures to display more appropriate images for the getting started entries.
-Alloy hammer recipe now requires an additional stick.
-Basic winding box is now much cheaper.
-Fixed recipes yielding incorrect gears (stupid mistake on my part).
-Fixed alloy hammer recipes to no longer screw up the stack size to 0.
-Reworked hourglasses to generate their time internally (should be a bit more efficient).
-Renamed time generators to time drives, and finally to time compressors (third time's the charm hopefully).
-Fixed timeframe key localizations (more idiotic mistakes on my part).
